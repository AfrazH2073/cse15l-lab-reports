Part 3:

I learned that there's a lot of ways to interact with web related services and servers in the search bar that connect to the URL's I see when I search for videos on YouTube or Google, when I add or do different operations on websites like calculators, etc. and those update on the URL in ways that I would always see but would never think about. In addition, In labs 2 and 3 I've been able to finally connect the terminal work that we do to my own computer for example, and navigating remoting into different computers, working with making my own code/methods, etc. that makes me really connect the relevance of my coding experience to linux.
